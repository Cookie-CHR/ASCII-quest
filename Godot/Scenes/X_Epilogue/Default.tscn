You still don't know if Little Timmy was actually the infector or not. For some time after his arrest, the not-translatable curse actually stopped spreading, and even receded in some points, but it didn't last long. In about a week, the plague slowly regained its speed and started expanding again.

While the Queen is sure this new comeback of the plague means there must be another infector around, the wizard didn't leave any comment about it. He also somehow managed to lose all the 100 gp of the reward - which is weird, because he hasn't been seen buying anything, aside from a couple bottles of wine from Mary's tavern."
