You have three potions in front of you: one of them is harmless and tastes like hot chocolate, the others will make you faint for several hours. What do you do?

Drink potion 1             (+10m)
Drink potion 2             (+several hours)
Drink potion 3             (+several hours)
---
You (the player) know potion 1 is the safe one, because of those time labels. This is \"guessing the outcome\" and, while making the game easier, it's also rather anticlimatic. For that reason, in the game, potions 2 and 3 won't have \"+ several hours\" in their label, but \"+10m\", like potion 1, even if they WILL actually take several hours."
