# The plot
The story takes place in a typical medieval-fantasy village called **Txtown**. One morning, the Queen makes an announcemente to all of her subjects: a powerful magic curse is leading to the town, a curse that only ASCII worlds can have: slowly, but inexorably, everything is turning into **not-translatable characters** (Like � or ▭).

The Queen is sure that the non-translatable pest is caused by somebody, an infector who spreads the curse to damage nearby kingdoms, and capturing them will stop the plague; she therefore put a huge bounty on the head of this mysteryous person, and whoever will bring her enough proofs will become a hero AND a very rich person.

In all this, you are just a common villager. Will you spend the day hunting and completing random side quests? Or will you help and find the infector? (Actually, is there an infector at all? Is there a plague at all? Will this random object be useful for some quest?)
